== Synopsis
cd /path/to/audiobook
mp3m4b *.mp3
mv out.m4b myaudiobook.m4b
open myaudiobook.m4b

== Details
Concatenates mp3 files (in the order given), transcodes to m4b, and adds
chapter information. The resulting file is an iPod audiobook complete with
chapter breaks.

Chapter titles are the mp3 filenames.

Tries to use the same bitrate as the first mp3 file.

Functionality is essentially the same as Audiobook Maker[1], but it's a  script
not a GUI.

== Requirements
The following should be in your path:

    ruby
    mp3info
    ffmpeg
    ChapterTool

Because it depends on ChapterTool, to my knowledge this restricts things to 
OS X. ChapterTool is included with GarageBand, but it's not in the path by
default. /Applications/GarageBand.app/Contents/MacOS/ChapterTool

ffmpeg and mp3info can be installed using MacPorts[2]. Alternatively, all three
binaries are included with Audiobook Maker. Ruby comes with all reasonably
modern versions of OS X, but is also available via MacPorts.

== Limitations
Doesn't do tags yet. Patches welcome. In the meantime, when you open the output
file with iTunes, just set the title and author.

There seems to be a limit on how big the audiobook gets before ChapterTool
chokes on it. I read somewhere about a 12-hour limit for iPods, but it worked
fine on a 12:39:48 audiobook. On the other hand, it failed on a 14-hour
audiobook. So consider breaking it up into pieces if it's particularly large.
If ChapterTool fails, the intermediate m4a file will not be deleted, and the
enclosing folder will be opened in Finder, so that you can attempt to use it
as-is (without chapters) if you don't want to wait for the whole thing to
transcode again.
